Disclosure Policy
When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.
In general, we ask that you not disclose an issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

If you have suggestions to improve this policy, please send an email to thesmallpixel@gmail.com.

Thank you for helping to keep BlazorDynamicForm and its users safe.
